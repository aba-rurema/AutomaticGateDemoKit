# AutomaticGateDemoKit
This Arduino project controls an automatic gate using an ultrasonic sensor to detect approaching objects. The system includes LED indicators, a servo motor for gate movement, and a buzzer for audible alerts.

Features
Ultrasonic Detection: Uses an HC-SR04 sensor to detect objects within 50cm

Servo-Controlled Gate: Opens to 90Â° when object detected, closes after 5 seconds of no detection

Visual Indicators:

Red LED: Gate closed (default state)

Blue LED: Gate open

Audible Alert: Buzzer activates when object is detected
